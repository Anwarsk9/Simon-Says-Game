### Listen to the Sequence:
Simon (the game) will show a sequence of colored lights, sounds, or both.

### Repeat the Sequence:
After Simon completes the sequence, it's your turn to repeat it.
Use the same sequence of colors in the exact order.

### Continue Playing:
The game continues by alternating between Simon's turn and your turn.

### Game Over on Mistake:
